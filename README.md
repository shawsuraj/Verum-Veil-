# Verum-Veil
**Verum-Veil** is an encryption tool with a twist! Inspired by the theme **"Hide in Plain Sight",** it offers a fun way to encrypt and decrypt messages using various unique methods. Whether you're looking to hide secrets in plain sight or just have fun with encryption, Verum-Veil has got you covered!

## Features

### **Encryption/decryption methods**:
1. **AI Sentence Crypt**: This method takes your original message and converts it into a completely random English sentence that carries a different meaning. The encrypted message will only be decryptable when you use the same password that was used to encrypt it, ensuring security and secrecy.

2.  **SkipCode**: Inspired by Sherlock Holmes's "The Empty Hearse" episode, this method adds randomly generated, contextually appropriate words into your sentence. These words will change the meaning of the sentence and make them appear normal, but only the person who knows the key can decrypt the original message.

3. **Emoji Crypt**: Emojis are no longer just for emotions! This method encodes your message into a sequence of emojis. The message can only be decrypted using the password, ensuring that only someone with the correct key can retrieve the original message.

**Encrypt a message**: Turn your regular message into a hidden secret using one of several fun encryption methods.

**Decrypt a message**: Reverse the encryption process to reveal the original message.
